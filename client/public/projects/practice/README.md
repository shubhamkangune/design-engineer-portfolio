Project images for "practice" projects

Place any project images you want publicly served in this folder. Guidelines:

- Accepted formats: JPG, PNG, WebP (prefer WebP for smaller size).
- Recommended hero image size: 1600×900 px (landscape). Thumbnails: 800×450 px.
- Naming convention:
  - hero.jpg (main image for the project)
  - thumb.jpg (small thumbnail)
  - gallery-1.jpg, gallery-2.jpg, ... (additional images)
  - Optionally include `@2x` or `@3x` suffixes for high-DPI variants (e.g. `hero@2x.jpg`).
- Image optimization: compress images and keep file sizes reasonable (prefer < 500 KB for hero).
- If your site expects specific filenames or metadata, match those names here so the frontend can load them automatically.

If you need to include other assets (PDFs, data sheets), create a subfolder and reference them relative to this folder.
